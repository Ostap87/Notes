Working ETHICET

Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out/Thank you for getting back to me.

I'd be happy to have an interview/come in for an interview.

Monday, September 4th, at 12PM works best for me. Please confirm if that works for you.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,

Keke
Thank you! I look forward to speaking with you!
Send this within an hour or so of interview, if possible. If not, early morning next day is fine.

Hello John,

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. I really appreciated our conversation. [INSERT SPECIAL OCCURRENCE FROM INTERVIEW: I especially enjoyed our conversation about Barcelona]. 

I learned a great deal about the company, the position, and the team. And I truly feel that I would be a great fit for this role. 

(We have to send this thank-you email within the same day you interviewed.)

Please let me know if you need anything further from me in the meantime. 

Again, it was a great pleasure meeting you. I look forward to hearing from you!

Best, 
Keke.

Hello John, 

I hope you're doing well. I would like to follow up on the status of my application. 

I had a great time speaking with you and X, X, and X. And I was wondering if there is anything I can do or provide, to move my application to the next phase. 

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best, 

Keke
