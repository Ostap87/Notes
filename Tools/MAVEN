Maven - management building tool. Maven is a command line tool, to use maven we have to use the MVN command. mvn is a main keyword - every main command starts with mvn


mvn archetyre:generate  ---> command to create project from archetype

archetype  ---> template, sample

groupid  --> name of the owner, the company

in maven, any operation that maven does is called build.
	builds either fail or pass



	in maven, src folder has 2 folders
		main: contains the actual application code
		test: contains the tests



project directory/ project folder. --> top level folder of the project

in mave we always have the   <pom.xml>. file in the project folder

pom.xml --> contain all configuration for maven project.

Lifecycle == Goal ---> maven commands that carry out certain phase of the project build

to run any goal, using terminal we have to change to project home directory

compile  --> goal is compile the project

src. --> all the source code including tests will be here

target. --> anuthing generated by maven will be here such as class file, reports

mvn clean --> cleans the project, removes the target folder

mvn test --> lifecycle that runs all the tests in the src/test/folder


mvn eclipse:eclipse. --> prepares the maven project for eclipse.

file -> Import-> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects -> Browse -> folow to MavenFolder -> Done

file --> new --> other  --> maven project -> create 


<dependencies>  --> tag which contain all dependencies
