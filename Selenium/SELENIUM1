Assert vs Verify

if Assert step fails, execution stops at that point.
if Verify step fails, it will report a fail but will continue execution

SoftAssert softAs = new SoftAssert();

in the end of code --> softAs.assertAll();

=====================


Soft Assertions(or verifications) , Hard Assertions(or assortion)
Comes from(TestNG) class framewwork/ library and it has different types of assertions methods:

ex: assertEquals(actualResult, expectedResult);
	assertTrue(boolean);
	assertFalse(boolean);

Hard assertions ---> terminates the test execution when it is fails
It only terminates the execution of @Test annotation


SoftAssert ---> class thet comes from testing and it handles the soft assertions.
Soft assertions ---> does not terminate the test execution even it fails. It simly memorizes which assertion failed. 
AssertAll ==> a method comes from SoftAssert class and it reports all the memorized failures.
Unless you use assertAll method explicitly in the end of the test it does not report which
 one fail
