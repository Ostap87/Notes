		               ======= ABOUT MYSELF =======

 I am senior QA engineer with 7y. experience in e-Commerce, financy and telecom.industries
During this time I have perform many types of manual and automation testings.
For the automation I use Selenium WebDriver tool based on the Java programming language 
	to develop and execute automated test scripts. 
Also for testing I use Cucumber software tool based on Gherkin language with JUNIT or
	TESTNG to define test cases and make it easy readable for other non technical people.

I use Jira as project management and defect tracking tool.
Also Git - version control tool to track all the history of modifications and
	push/pull through GitHub development platform. 
Also, I use Maven to manage different dependencies in my framework.
For executing daily and nightly tests I use continious integration tool Jenkins.

My framework is Behavier Driven framework with Page Object Model Designe pattern,
 but I am familiar with Data Driven, Keyword Driven, Hybrid frameworks.

I used to work in Waterfall but now I am in Agile environment, where me and my TEAM
	(8 members) participate daily stand up/grooming/sprint planning/review/retrospective 
	meetings - to discuss, planning, resolving problems,reviews etc.

My responsibility is smoke test and regration tests. Daily auto script development.
If you ask my co-workers they would, probably describe me as hardworking, responsible,
always smilling and easy going, from myself I am a team player

//I am analitical, detail,result and team oriented person,  
//Filling myself technicaly strong in testing.
