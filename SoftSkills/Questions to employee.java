Biggest bugs:

->We could close the new window in 2 ways:
By clicking X at the top right corner of the page -By clicking “Close” button on the page
By pressing combination keys (Alt+F4) on the key board
Although the combination key (Alt+F4) was not mentioned in the test case, I just wanted to try 
how the application reacts when Alt+F4 is pressed. Then I pressed Alt+F4. The result was 
a disaster-the application crashed (broke). The application disappeared from the computer 
monitor. Since it was the last day of testing for us, it brought chaos in our Managers, 
Leads and the whole teams. Finally, the developers disabled Alt+F4 as a temporary solution 
and the application went into production.
