Sample:

Rough summary of what he said (I missed a few things here or there):

“I started as a manual tester and moved to automation. So far I’ve worked in the healthcare, insurance, banking and mortgage industries. In these 8 years, I’ve been mainly testing web applications but I also have experience with client server applications.

My main language is Java, but I know SQL as well as Gherkin. I’ve also used Javascript on occasion when whe have a difficult time reaching [I didn’t catch what he said here].

For testing purposes, I mainly use TestNG, and I’m also familiar with Selenium and Cucumber as well. Recently, I’ve been working with Maven for project building, but I’m also familiar with Ant.

We’ve also been using Jira for our project management tool, but I’m also familiar with ALM. For Continuous Integration, we’re using Jenkins. My main framework is POM, but I’m also familiar with keyword-driven, data-driven, and hybrid frameworks, but in the last few years I’ve mainly worked with POM which is a very popular tool.

I started in Waterfall environment, but then moved to Agile. I’m familiar with all sprint-related Scrum ceremonies.

My responsibilities right now are smoke testing, functional testing and regression testing. But I’m familiar with most testing types.

If you ask my coworkers, they’d describe me as hard working, easy going and a great team player. “
