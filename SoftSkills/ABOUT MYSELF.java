Also for testing I use Cucumber software tool based on Gherkin language with JUNIT or
	TESTNG to define test cases and make it easy readable for other non technical people.
For back end use JDBC libraries and Restful API.

I use Jira or ALM as project management and defect tracking tool.
Also Git - version control tool to track all the history of modifications and
	push/pull through GitHub development platform. 
Also, I use Maven to manage different dependencies in my framework.
For executing daily and nightly tests I use continious integration tool Jenkins or TeamCity.

My framework is Behavier Driven framework with Page Object Model Designe pattern,
 but I am familiar with Data Driven, Keyword Driven and Hybrid frameworks.
