AGILE - small deliverable/ be ready for a change
"
1. Product Backlog - PO create and prioritize list of feature known as users stories
(way of describing of feature set:-As "an Amazon user"; 
		 					   	  -I "should be able to login"; 
							   	  -So, that "I can buy stuff online";)  
 can change by priority with every sprint.
 actually this is entire application that we want to develop.

2. BurnDown Chart - show the progress during sprint(in Jira);

3. Acceptance criteria --> condition, criteria that mark the story complete. Basicly User Story.
	-Given the renter is on the search page
	-When the renter searches for apartments
	-Then the results should display the available apartments

 							===== Type Of Testing ======



Smoke Test - done to make sure that software under testing is ready or stable for further testing. 
---------------------------------
 - testing a whole application. Simply means do new features break old ones.
+make sure that whole component works properly even after adding components to the complete program.
---------------------------------
Functional Testing - testing does everything behave as expected and described in documentation.
---------------------------------
Performance Testing - <1000 users the same time>
---------------------------------
End-to-End Testing - testing back end and UI or different functionality as one test.
---------------------------------
Integration Testing - testing check if the units work well together.
---------------------------------
Usability Testing - testing are the user interfaces easy to operate and understand.
---------------------------------
Happy Path Testing - test an application successfully on a positive flow.
+it does not look for negative or error conditions. The focus is only on the valid and positive inputs
+through which application generates the expected output.
---------------------------------
Negative Testing - validate if system or app breaks. A negative testing technique is performed using 
+incorrect data. it validates that if the system throws an error of invalid input and behaves as expected
---------------------------------
Verification TEsting - mostly doing by developers to check are they build right things...
+what is expected result.
---------------------------------
Validations Testing - mostly by testers, are we doing in a right way...
"



Verification - to make sure the product behaves the way we want it to.
Validation - the product is build as per custumer requirements is it everything 
on a correct place

Definition of Ready  - if the user story clear to developers and testers. PO job,
 he needs to make it understandable
Definition of Done (DOD) - all acceptance criteria is done, all user stories fully tested
Acceptance criteria - comes from bussines, how they want to see functionality,requirement
document for user story

Sprint 2 weeks = 20 user stories - 80 points

Capacity -> how many resources in your team


Velocity -> average points were complited during the 1 sprint

'
Test plan -> every sprint
