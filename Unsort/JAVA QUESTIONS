JAVA QUESTIONS

Java coding challenges from early birds

        1.Write a method which prints out the numbers from 1 to 30
        but for numbers which are a multiple of 3, print “FIN” instead of the number
        and for numbers which are a multiple of 5, print “RA” instead of the number
        for numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FINRA” instead of the number.

        Hint:
        for(int i=1; i<31; i++){
           if(i%3==0&&i%5==0){

           }
           and so..
        }
        use %
        for loop
        if statement
        Print


        2. Write a method that will remove all dupplicates from string
        removeDup(“abccccccc”); -> “abc”

        Hint:
        Use: empty ArrayList

        3. Write a method that will count number of each char in a String
        countChar(“abbc”); -> {a=1, b=2, c=1}

       

        4. Write a method that will print only unique letters of given string
        printUnique(“aabbc”) -> “c”
        printUnique(“aabc”) -> “bc”

  
        6. Method that prints numbers in fibonacci sequence in java. In fibonacci series,
        next number is the sum of previous two numbers for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc.
        The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1. Method will accepts one int as arg.
        fibonacci(5); -> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3
        fibonacci(8); -> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,

        7. Write me a method which can identifies given number is even or odd
        identify(5) -> print “Odd”
        identify(6) -> print “Even”

        8. Write a method that returns string version of int
        convert(4321) -> print “four thousand three hundred and twenty one”

        9. Write a program to print all permutations of a given string. This one is crazy
        permutation(“ABC”) -> “ABC ACB BAC BCA CBA CAB”

        10. Write a method to print a diamond of astercics
        diamond(); - >
        *
        *
        ***
        *
        *
        11. Write a method that returns max value out of array of integers, and than Srtings.
        int[] arr = {2,3,4};
        max(arr) -> 4

        12. You have a sentence in a String : ‘’Mom and dad in a racecar ‘’ --> find and return the biggest palindrome

        and then write all possible ways how to test the function that i just did.
