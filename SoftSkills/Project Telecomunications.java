My current project is an internal application for telecomunication companys employees,
the main purpose of that is to help manage new and completed work orders, analyze data, 
billing and customer service. Every work order contains a customer information,
work description, employees and company contractors information.

>>>>>In that my role is:
	-Requirement Analysiing;
	-Designing and Coding automation script,I utilize SELENIUM WEBDRIVER tool for that purpose;
	-Testing.

>>>>>Main modules that I am working with are:

	Dispatch module - when tech are calling to dispatch to get some help, he gives his tech id,
+ dispatch can see general info about tech, appointment location, what is suppose to be done there,
+ who created the work order-(sale person), how are codes looks like-(is it needs to make changes);
	-------------------------------------------
	Technician module - tech change his status info, system notify dispatch and sent message to customer
+ about tech location-(could be track on the map) and ETA. Tech add/remove/re-de-activate equipment
+ sending special commands;
	-------------------------------------------
	Completed Work Orders module - tech add special codes,reporting what he done during the current
+ appointment, this codes translates to other codes and create a list with prices that company will pay
+ for executed job type and make a charge/fee/discount for custumer;
	-------------------------------------------
	Customer module - which consists of customer information, and work thats been done at that address;
	-------------------------------------------
	Technical part.

In our application we had a lot of old components that were changed to new functionalities,
and a lot more new functionalities are gonna be added,the people that developed that framework for old 
componets they are no longer working with this company,so now its my responsibility to manage, fix it
or update that old framework. But after some time we figured that it would be too time 
consuming, and we decided to go ahead and write new script,that would be able to handle all of the 
functionalities that will be added in future.
	
	


	Usualy there is nothing wrong with my test script because i ve gone through a lot of challanges 
	and I know how to handle those dynamic objects that may change any time,because there are a lot
	of them out there, so I had to figure out the most efficient and effective way to do it.
	*********************************************
	I will go ahead and fix it up a little bit,reword it.
	We developed custom HTML report with developers,its a kinda webtable,the management loves that.
	I am responsible for all email automation
	I documented the best practices that I used with descriptive programming
	
	Major challenge is identifying the proper structure for the framework.

================================
In this project I.m working as a Senior Automation Engineer last 2 y. My measure is
70% automation and 20% manual and functional testing whenever it.s required. 
FOr front end automation we used SELENIUM with Java. I.m pretty much comfortable with Java and
all OOP concept.  Also, I.m responsible for designing framework. When they hired me for 
automation activities I took a challange and represent POM for my team, then hire management
after that we have more than 80% of automation. Initially it was a lot of manual test cases and 
we took that tc and converted to automation. Also, I do back end testing using Rest Assure
