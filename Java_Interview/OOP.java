					============OOP============

Encapsulation -> hiding direct access to the data by using 'private' key and 
increased flexibility, if needs access - have to use 'getter' and 'setter' method.

Abstraction -> is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user.
only the functionality will be provided to the user. 
in Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
- use abstract keyword;
- can not be instantiated directly;
- can extend other abstract class and implement only interface;
- child class inherits all properties from parent;
- may or may not have all abstract methods;
- can have parametrized constructors and default constructor is always present

Inheritance -> is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the 
features(fields and methods) of another class.

when child class requires all properties and behaviours of parent class.
used to define the relationship between two classes. Child class can re-use script 
written in parent class - code re-usibility

Polymorphism ->  is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); 
we use 'overloading' and 'overriding' to achieve polymorphism
